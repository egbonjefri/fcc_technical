              <p>Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is an innovative technology that produces functional tissues by patterning living cells, biological factors
                 and biomaterials in a precisely controlled manner. It is a form of additive manufacturing that uses cells and other biocompatible materials 
                 commonly referred to as “inks”, (also known as bioinks), to print living structures layer-by-layer, which ultimately mimic the behavior of natural living systems.</p>
              <p>Bioprinted constructs can be used to study functions of a human body outside outside the normal physiological environment. (<em>in vitro</em>), in 3D. 
                The architecture of a 3D bioprinted structure is much more biologically relevant and similar to that of a naturally occurring biological system than a traditional <em>in vitro</em> study performed in flat 2D petri dishes. 
              </p>
                <p>Currently, bioprinting can be used to print tissues and organs to help research drugs, and in the future will be used for medical applications in clinical settings
                   – 3D printed skin grafts, bone grafts, implants, biomedical devices, and even full 3D printed organs are all active topics of bioprinting research.</p>

                <header>How does 3D bioprinting work?</header>
                <article>
                  <p>3D bioprinting starts with a model of a structure, which is recreated layer-by-layer out of a bioink either mixed with living cells, 
                    or seeded with cells after the print is complete. These starting models can come from anywhere – a CT or MRI scan, a computer generated 
                    design (CAD) program, or a file downloaded from the internet.</p>
                    <p>That 3D model file is then fed into a slicer – a specialized kind of computer program which analyzes the geometry of the model and generates 
                      a series of thin layers, or slices, which form the shape of the original model when stacked vertically. Cura and slic3r are examples of slicers 
                      commonly used in 3D printing.</p>
                      <p>Once a model is sliced, the slices are transformed into path data, stored as a g-code file, which can be sent to a 3D bioprinter for printing.
                         The bioprinter follows instructions in the g-code file in order, including instructions to control for temperature of the extruders, extrusion pressure, 
                         bed plate temperature, crosslinking intensity and frequency, and, of course, the 3D movement path generated by the slicer. Once all of the g-code commands 
                         are completed, the print is done and can be cultured or seeded with cells as part of a biostudy.</p>

                  <p>Over 120,000 people in the US alone are on waiting lists for organs, and others experience chronic problems due to the long-term damaging effects of post-transplant
                     immunosuppression. There’s a large and growing need for an alternative to the organ transplant waiting list. The scientific community has already succeeded in bringing 
                     together multidisciplinary teams of researchers, physicians, and engineers to take on the biggest challenges to human health, and 3D bioprinting is an exciting new tool 
                     with the potential to eliminate the organ transplant waiting list.</p>
                     <p>For pharmaceutical development, 3D bioprinting offers a means of testing drugs faster, at a lower cost, and with better biological relevance to humans than animal testing.</p>
                     <p>In the biomedical devices field, 3D bioprinting has enabled new developments such as sugar stents to help surgeons join veins with fewer complications, and systems for improved drug delivery, among others.</p>
                     <p>As bioprinting evolves, it will become possible to use a patient’s own cells to 3D print skin and bone grafts, organ patches, and even full replacement organs.</p>
                     <p>Personalized and regenerative medicine continue to grow in popularity, and 3D bioprinting will give doctors and researchers the tools to better target treatments and improve patient outcomes.</p>

                <article>
                  <p>3D bioprinting generally follows three steps, pre-bioprinting, bioprinting, and post-bioprinting.</p>
                  <h3>Pre-Bioprinting</h3>
                  <p>Proin neque ex, aliquet nec sagittis ac, commodo mattis est. Suspendisse lectus tellus, ullamcorper sed gravida et, ullamcorper ac neque. Duis mattis purus eget dui fermentum molestie. Morbi turpis eros, tempor a bibendum sit amet, pellentesque ut eros. Etiam vitae metus non lectus mollis lacinia.</p>
                    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut sed eleifend magna. Mauris vestibulum tincidunt nibh sed porttitor. Maecenas porttitor bibendum lectus, sit amet semper nulla semper eu. Nam lacus urna, varius eu molestie eget, faucibus et risus. Duis volutpat, nunc sed faucibus tincidunt, turpis justo lacinia neque, id consequat elit lectus a ex</p>
                       <h3>Bioprinting</h3>
                  <p>In the second step, the liquid mixture of cells, matrix, and nutrients known as bioinks are placed in a printer cartridge and deposited using the patients' medical scans.
                     When a bioprinted pre-tissue is transferred to an incubator, this cell-based pre-tissue matures into a tissue.</p>
                     <p>3D bioprinting for fabricating biological constructs typically involves dispensing cells onto a biocompatible scaffold using a successive layer-by-layer approach to generate tissue-like three-dimensional structures.
                        Artificial organs such as livers and kidneys made by 3D bioprinting have been shown to lack crucial elements that affect the body such as working blood vessels, tubules for collecting urine, and the growth of billions of cells required for these organs.
                         Without these components the body has no way to get the essential nutrients and oxygen deep within their interiors</p>
                    <p>Given that every tissue in the body is naturally composed of different cell types, many technologies for printing these cells vary in their ability to ensure stability and viability of the cells during the manufacturing process. 
                      Some of the methods that are used for 3D bioprinting of cells are photolithography, magnetic 3D bioprinting, stereolithography, and direct cell extrusion.</p>
                       <h3>Post-Bioprinting</h3>
                  <p>The post-bioprinting process is necessary to create a stable structure from the biological material. If this process is not well-maintained, the mechanical integrity and function of the 3D printed object is at risk</p>

                <p>Bioinks are biomaterials used in 3D bioprinting. A bioink’s material properties affect its interactions with cells and its success as a bioprinted construct.
                   One way to make sense of the wide range of materials used in bioprinting is to sort them by their roles in the printing process.
                    A given bioink can be a matrix ink, a support ink, or a sacrificial ink.</p>

                  <p>There are many different printers on the market and methods for delivering these cells and biomaterials also differ. Universities, researchers and private companies around the world are all currently working on advancing bioprinting technologies.</p>
                  <p>Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, and each presents unique challenges to be overcome. Researchers predict it will be the combination of several of these techniques that will provide the most significant advancements in bioprinting. </p>
                  <p>Some of the more commonly used bioprinters include:</p>

                  <p>A human organ has a complex web of cells, tissues, nerves and structures that need to be correctly positioned for the organ to function properly. 
                    From arranging the thousands of tiny capillaries in a liver, to actually getting a printed heart to ‘beat’ and contract—it’s a long, difficult process. 
                     Added to this is the selection and availability of the right materials, cell types, and creating bio-inks that meet the dual demands of both printability and cell functionality. 
                    There is also the need to take in to account different growth rates and differentiation factors, as well as developing the right software and hardware to make 
                    it all come together.</p>
                    <p>Even after researchers believe they have it all ‘right’, bioprinted technologies are still required to pass safety tests and proper regulatory processes before they can be made available to the public.</p>
                   <p>Working through all these complexities requires the integration and input of technologies from fields including engineering, biomaterials science, cell biology, physics and medicine. So, you’ll just have to be a little more patient! </p>

                  <p>Given its interdisciplinary nature, 3D bioprinting is accelerating at an ever-increasing rate. It’s exciting times, however, we need to be careful to temper our expectations of this technology with the realities. The human body is incredibly complex, and trying to replicate the many things that it does is difficult, challenging work. Those working in the field are making advances every day, in both the technology and in their understanding of how it can be used and improved. While we’re not quite there yet, there is no doubt that the future of medicine will be very different with bioprinting involved.</p>
